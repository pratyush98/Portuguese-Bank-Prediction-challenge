# Portuguese-Bank-Prediction-challenge
The Portuguese Bank had run a telemarketing campaign in the past, making sales calls for a term-deposit product. Whether a prospect had bought the product or not is mentioned in the column named 'response'.  The marketing team wants to launch another campaign, and they want to learn from the past one. The maximisation of the profit needs best prediction technique. We used feature selection for getting the feature importance according to the tree classifier we used it to fit it. I used a TSNE plot to show the variance of the data in a 2d plot. For prediction i used SMOTE to over sample the data and get the dataset balanced to get the predictions.
